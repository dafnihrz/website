    <dt>Do you only have one size of cupcakes?</dt>
        <dd>We offer three cupcake sizes to fit every occasion: mini, classic, and jumbo.</dd>
    <dt>How long will my cupcakes stay fresh?</dt>
        <dd>For the ultimate cupcake experience, the best time for consumption is on the day you 
            receive them. However, keeping them in their carrier container is generally best for up 
            to two days at room temperature and up to a week in the refrigerator.</dd>
    <dt>Do you make cakes or cookie?</dt>
        <dd>Not at the moment but hope to in the near future :)</dd>
