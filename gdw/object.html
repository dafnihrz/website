<h2>Everybody Talks</h2>
<p>by Neon Trees</p>
<hr style="width: 30%;text-align: left;margin-left: 0;">

<p>     Hey baby, won't you look my way?<br>
        I can be your new addiction<br>
        Hey baby, what you gotta say?<br>
        All you're giving me is fiction<br>
        I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time<br>
        I found out that everybody talks<br>
        Everybody talks, everybody talks<br>
</p>
<p>     It started with a whisper<br>
        And that was when I kissed her<br>
        And then she made my lips hurt<br>
        I could hear the chit chat<br>
        Take me to your love shack<br>
        Mama's always gotta back track<br>
        When everybody talks back<br>
</p>
<p>
        Hey honey, you could be my drug<br>
        You could be my new prescription<br>
        Too much could be an overdose<br>
        All this trash talk make me itchin'<br>
        Oh my, my sh-<br>
        Everybody talks, everybody talks<br>
        Everybody talks, too much<br>
</p>
<p>It started with a whisper<br>
And that was when I kissed her<br>
And then she made my lips hurt<br>
I could hear the chit chat<br>
Take me to your love shack<br>
Mama's always gotta back track<br>
When everybody talks back<br>
</p>
<p>Never thought I'd live<br>
To see the day<br>
When everybody's words got in the way<br>
</p>
<p>Hey</p>
<p>Hey sugar, show me all your love<br>
All you're giving me is friction<br>
Hey sugar, what you gotta say?<br>
</p>
<p>It started with a whisper<br>
And that was when I kissed her<br>
And then she made my lips hurt<br>
I could hear the chit chat<br>
Take me to your love shack<br>
Mama's always gotta back track<br>
When everybody talks back<br>
</p>
<p>Everybody talks<br>
Everybody talks<br>
Everybody talks<br>
Everybody talks<br>
Everybody talks<br>
Everybody talks, back<br>
</p>
<p>It started with a whisper (everybody talks, everybody talks)<br>
And that was when I kissed her (everybody talks, everybody talks)<br>
</p>
<p>
Everybody talks<br>
Everybody talks, back<br>
