        <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
        <p> Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!
        </p>
        <h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

        <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
        through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.
        </p>
        <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
        <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
        road today: 
          <blockquote>
          Passing cars, <br>
          When you can't see, <br>
          May get you, <br>
          A glimpse, <br>
          Of eternity.<br>
          </blockquote>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.
        </p>
        <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
        <img src="images/segway1.jpg" alt="Segway 2">
        <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
