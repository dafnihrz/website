    <li><div class="question">What solution are we using to the problem presented in the chapter of finding yourself a 
        hosting company? What are the advantages and disadvantages of our solution? What alternatives could we have used,
        and which alternative did we use earlier in the year?</div>
        <ul>
            <li>The solution presented in the book was to simply research hosting services yourself. They gave some recomednations
                but ultimately you make a decision yourself. Our class decided to use GitHub. You can publish a website using 
                a free domain with Github. The biggest advantage of Github is version control, a feature that tracks the history of changes.
                This is useful because as you make more changes to a project, you can retrieve an earlier version at any time.
                A disadvantage of using Github is that you cannot host an e-commerce page since it is not intended to host sites that 
                involve commercial transactions. In the beginning of the year, the class connected to a server in New Jersey.</li><br>

        A few of our enterprising classmates have taken the initiative to register their own domain name. See if you can find 
        these classmates and ask them how they did it. What is the process involved? Where can you go to register a domain name?</div>
        <ul>
            <li>They used Google Domains (domain service by Google). You buy the domain and set it up by editing the DNS record and IP address.
                The DNS record tells the web where the domain should go to. Other alternatives are Namecheap, GoDaddy, HostGator, etc.</li><br>

        Comparison of the workflow presented in the book (which is a bit old at this point) with the one we use:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>In the book, you had to log into FTP (File Transfer Protocol) in order to transfer your files to a directory there. We use Github
                to commit and push files in order to add files to our repository. Both methods are similar because both transfer files.
